## 📝 Working Practices

1. **Document Everything:** Keep detailed notes in `20-protocol/` for all meetings and decisions
2. **Update Regularly:** Maintain progress documentation to demonstrate ongoing work
3. **Organize References:** Use `40-references/` systematically with proper citations
4. **Plan Iteratively:** Update `10-planning/` as the project evolves
5. **Prepare Deliverables Early:** Use `00-deliverables/` to stage materials before deadlines
