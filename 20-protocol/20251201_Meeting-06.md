# Meeting Protocol #06
**Date:** December 1, 2025  
**Type:** Supervisor Meeting  
**Attendees:** Sofya, Jhannes, Feng, Pejman  

---

## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### Setup Explanation
- Presented our current testing setup in detail
- Explained how **mitmproxy** is used and that it operates as a **transparent proxy**

### Test Case Execution Uncertainty
- **Problem:** Unclear how the paper actually executed the test cases
  - During the auto-detect process?
  - When reloading settings?
  - When sending emails?
- **Decision:** We will test all scenarios to cover all possibilities

### S/MIME Discussion (Discarded)
- Pejman suggested looking into **S/MIME** and whether it would prevent these attacks
- Counter-argument: S/MIME is not directly related to auto-detect and the core idea of the paper
- **Outcome:** Idea was discarded during the meeting

### Lightning Talk Preparation (Next Week)
- **Format:** Only one slide needed, or even just a whiteboard explanation would suffice
- **Presentation Structure:**
  1. What we are trying to do and why (TLS downgrade attacks)
  2. Show the paper and their main idea (including theoretical part → 4 test cases)
  3. Our setup (server, proxy setup, testing setup, Thunderbird for now + potentially finding 1 vulnerable client)
