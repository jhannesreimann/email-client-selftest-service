## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### Self-test Service Live Demo (Client Downgrade Simulation)
- Presented the **selftest-server** and ran a **live demo** of the workflow
- Explained the core idea: instead of a full MITM proxy, the server **simulates disruption modes** (T1–T4-style behaviors) directly in the protocol handlers
- Discussed implications and limitations of this approach:
  - the server is effectively **“proxy + server”** in one component (simulation rather than interception)
  - limitations around correlating multiple devices in the same network due to the current **IP-dependent behavior/overrides**

### Scope Clarification: Is the Project “Enough”?
- Clarified that the current self-test service is **sufficient for the seminar context** if we focus on:
  - clearly documenting the **structure and methodology**
  - explaining the motivation and why this design is appropriate
  - not aiming to fully recreate all paper measurements if that becomes too broad
- Discussed a potential extension:
  - a **mail server checker script** for mail admins that tests server configuration/capabilities and outputs a clear result
  - this is expected to be **simpler** than full client testing because it focuses on server-side configuration checks

### Fingerprinting / IP Dependence
- Noted that the current IP dependence and lack of “perfect fingerprinting” is **not a major issue** for the seminar scope
- Session isolation / stronger fingerprinting becomes more relevant as a **future improvement** beyond the seminar

### Justifying the Simulation (vs. Full MITM Proxy)
- Confirmed that the simulation approach is acceptable as long as we:
  - argue clearly **why** it is used (practicality, deployability, reproducibility)
  - describe what is **simulated** vs what a real proxy would observe/control
  - explain the implications (e.g., assumptions about attacker behavior and where manipulation occurs)

### Hosting / EC2 Cost Discussion
- Discussed EC2 costs and how to handle payment:
  - use an **invoice to the official HPI address**
- Considered longer-term: possibly hosting officially within the HPI network
  - requires a clear specification of **open ports** and **security measures**

### Access Control for the Web UI
- Identified a near-term improvement:
  - add a **simple login/access control** so the Web UI is not publicly accessible to everyone from the outside

### Presentation Logistics
- Clarified presentation constraints:
  - **40 minutes total**, including discussion
  - target **~30 minutes talk**, rest discussion
- Demo format:
  - live demo or video are both acceptable
  - live demo only if the implementation is **stable enough** to minimize failure risk

### Feedback
- Received positive feedback; supervisors expressed **satisfaction and support**.

## ✅ Action Items

- [ ] Write up a clear justification of the **server-based simulation approach** and its implications
- [ ] Decide whether to scope in a **mail server checker script** (admin-focused) as an extension
- [ ] Add **basic access control/login** for the Web UI before broader exposure
- [ ] Prepare presentation structure for next week:
  - 30 min content + discussion
  - decide between video vs live demo
- [ ] If moving hosting to HPI network becomes relevant:
  - document required ports + security considerations for approval

---

## 📅 Next Steps

- Focus the write-up on the self-test service methodology and structure
- Finalize presentation plan and decide demo format
- Evaluate feasibility and scope of the optional server-checker script
