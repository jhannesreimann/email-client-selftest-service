# Meeting Protocol #03
**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Type:** Supervisor Meeting (Online via Zoom)  
**Attendees:** Sofya, Jhannes, Feng, Pejman

## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### Paper Selection Update
- **Decision:** The two previously considered papers are **not feasible** for the project:
  1. **Jolt** (Recovering TLS Signing Keys via Rowhammer Faults)
  2. **Post-Quantum Cryptography Fingerprinting**
- **Backup Plan:** Fingerprinting paper remains as fallback option if main approach doesn't work
- **Alternative Fallback:** Easier, more basic email security topic

### New Focus: "A Multifaceted Study on the Use of TLS and Auto-detect in Email Ecosystems" (NDSS 2025)
- **Plan Presentation:** Team presented detailed plan for reproducing this paper
- **Documents Reviewed:**
  - [Discussion Plan](../10-planning/20251110_discussion_plan.md)
  - [Paper Summary: A Multifaceted Study on TLS and Auto-detect in Email Ecosystems](../30-summary/Summary_2025Paper_NDSS_A%20%20Multifaceted%20Study%20on%20the%20Use%20of%20TLS%20and%20Auto-detect%20in%20Email%20Ecosystems.md)

## 🔧 Infrastructure Requirements

### Domain & Server Resources
- **Domain Question:** Do we need a domain for the project?
  - **Cheng's Offer:** Has existing domains available, or team can purchase new one from budget (no problem)
  - **Decision:** First determine if domain is needed for initial proof of concept
  
- **Server Requirements:**
  - Once we know exact specifications (OS, memory, RAM), email Cheng with details
  - Cheng will provide/find solution

### Technical Scope Decisions
1. **Domain:** Clarify need for initial proof of concept before requesting
2. **Operating Systems:** Exclude Apple OSes - start with clients on Linux locally
3. **Fallback Options:** Research classical attacks on email security
   - Consider linked coursebooks on networks for relevant attacks

## 🎯 Goals for Next Meeting

### Implementation & Understanding
- **Primary Goal:** Both team members should fully understand the paper and GitHub setup
- **Hands-on Work:** Each team member attempts to get the provided code working
  - Options: VM or local setup
  - Merge findings and present first prototype at next meeting

### Resource Planning
- **Preparation:** Fully understand the setup requirements
- **Email to Supervisors:** Once setup is clear, send email detailing needed resources (server & domain)
- **Timeline:** Aim to send resource request email before next meeting (work on Monday/Tuesday)

## ✅ Action Items

- [ ] Both team members: Fully understand the NDSS paper and experimental setup
- [ ] Set up and test the provided GitHub code (VM or local environment)
- [ ] Determine exact infrastructure needs (domain, server specifications)
- [ ] Email Cheng with resource requirements once details are finalized
- [ ] Prepare first prototype/proof of concept for next meeting
- [ ] Research classical email security attacks as potential fallback topic
