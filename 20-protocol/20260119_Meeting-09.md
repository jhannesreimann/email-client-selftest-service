## Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Intermediate Presentation feedback

* **Content (8/10):**

  * more intro needed on how TLS and client interact.
  * Shodan needs clearer explanation.
  * Referenced paper -  it was unclear what exactly was reused vs. newly implemented.
* **Technical Details (8/10):**

  * Design and implementation challenges were discussed.
  * Key technical contributions should be emphasized.
* **Demo (9.5/10):**

  * Very strong demo overall, but some parts were not clear

### 2. Paper & Presentation Structure

* IEEE-style structure recommended:

  * Problems
  * Solutions
  * Proposal
  * Challenges
  * Future Work
* Slides can be reused, but with a **different storyline** aligned with a paper-style narrative.
* Final presentation should be structured like a research paper.

### 3. State of the Art & Research Focus

* Need to clearly explain the **state of the art** regarding:
  * How TLS should be applied on the client side.

* Clarify the **research problem**:
  * Focus on the **scalability limitations** of the original approach.

* Important clarification:
  * **No setup is required on the client side** in the proposed approach.

### 4. Experiments & Validation

* Experiments are required to:

  * Verify the correctness and effectiveness of the implementation.
  * Need to explain:

    * How clients are tested.
    * Existing client testing mechanisms.
    * General practices used in the community for testing TLS clients.

### 5. Implementation Details to Add

* Include more **code-level details**, especially:

  * Handlers (input/outputs)

## ✅ Action Items

* [ ] Rework presentation with new structure
* [ ] Clearly explain state-of-the-art TLS usage on the client side
* [ ] Clarify research problem focusing on scalability
* [ ] Add detailed explanation of Shodan usage
* [ ] Highlight implementation challenges and key contributions
* [ ] Include code details (e.g., handlers) in the final presentation
* [ ] Design and run experiments to validate the implementation
* [ ] Describe existing client testing mechanisms and testing methodology
* [ ] Ensure clarity that no client-side setup is required
