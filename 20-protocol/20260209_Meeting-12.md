## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Final Presentation PowerPoint Review
- Walked through the current **PowerPoint draft** for the final presentation together.

### 2. Introduction as Knowledge Foundation
- The introduction of the presentation should convey the **knowledge and understanding** that the team acquired over the course of the project — so that listeners gain the necessary background to follow the rest of the presentation.
- This is not about listing findings explicitly, but about **structuring the intro** in a way that naturally transfers this understanding to the audience.

### 3. Email Security Introduction
- Add a dedicated, **explicit section at the beginning** covering **general email security** and how **SSL/TLS is used** in email:
  - From the **email server perspective**: how servers are configured and secured.
  - From the **email client perspective**: what the end user sees and relies on.
- This section sets the stage before diving into the project's contributions.

### 4. Existing Analysis Tools
- Show **existing tools** for analyzing email security **early in the presentation** (currently placed at the end of the draft).
- Repositioning these tools earlier provides better context and motivation for the project.

### 5. Presentation Time Constraint
- The presentation must be **maximum 40 minutes** long, leaving at least **5 minutes for discussion**.

### 6. Demo: Focus on Events
- During the demo, put **more emphasis on the events** themselves — what they look like, how they are triggered, and what information they carry.

### 7. Shodan Explanation
- The Shodan section should explain **what Shodan does in general**, its **capabilities**, and importantly its **limitations** — what it **cannot** do.
- This naturally leads into the **motivation** for why our two tools are needed and why existing solutions like Shodan are **not sufficient**.

### 8. Motivation & Transition to Own Tools
- Use the Shodan limitations as a **transition** to explain why **both of our tools** (server-side and client-side) are necessary and what gap they fill.
