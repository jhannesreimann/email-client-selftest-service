## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### Shodan Findings
- Presented our current **Shodan-based passive measurement** results and plots
- Discussed what the findings indicate and how they support the overall motivation of the project

### Lightning Talk Feedback (08.12.)
- Received **9.5/10** points
- Feedback:
  - Presentation was a bit **poorly organized** / **hard to follow**
  - The whiteboard contained **too many test cases**, which was confusing

### Guidance for the Next Presentation
- We should explain the problem **more generally**:
  - What the core security problem is
  - How **TLS is used in practice** between mail client and mail server
- We should clearly explain our **test setup**, especially:
  - How the proxy/mitm setup works
  - Where interception/manipulation happens and what is being tested
- demonstrate attacks

### Extra Ideas / Extensions
- Idea: provide a script to test a **user-specified mail server** for misconfigurations by querying ports and capabilities and then outputting a clear assessment
- Idea: provide a similar “self-test” concept for **clients**, so users can test whether their own client allows downgrade-to-plaintext
  - Constraint: likely not feasible to automatically parse/configure every email client
  - Proposed approach: the script provides guided instructions, and based on the client’s observed behavior/messages the user can classify the result (secure vs insecure)
  - Open question: how to practically host/run the proxy for such a user-facing workflow

## ✅ Action Items

- [ ] Rework presentation structure for the next milestone:
  - Focus on a clear narrative and reduce complexity on the whiteboard
  - Add a short explanation of mail TLS / STARTTLS basics and threat model
  - Add a clear diagram of the proxy-based test setup
  - record demos
- [ ] Explore feasibility of a **mail server capability checker** script (ports + capabilities, no credentials)
- [ ] Explore feasibility of a **client self-test** workflow (guided steps + result classification)
- [ ] Clarify proxy hosting/deployment constraints for user-facing tests

---

## 📅 Next Steps

- Prepare the next presentation with a clearer, more general introduction and a well-structured setup explanation
- Evaluate and scope the “server checker” and “client self-test” ideas for Phase II extensions
