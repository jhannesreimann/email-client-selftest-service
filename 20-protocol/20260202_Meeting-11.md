## 📌 Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Paper and final Presentation Scope
- The paper must be **self-contained**, with a **maximum length of 10 pages**, using the **default IEEE format** (font size ~10).
- The final presentation  should be structured **from problem statement to conclusion**, as if there was **no intermediate presentation**.

### 2. Required Additions & Missing Content

#### a) Related Work
- Include a **section on similar work**, covering:
  - Existing **testing services** (general or email-specific).
  - Comparison of **server-side vs. client-side testing approaches**.
- Discuss **existing tools** for:
  - Email server configuration scanning.
  - Client-side scanning.
  - Security tools that analyze **email server logs**. - Address whether **real-world security issues** can be detected through server logs alone.

#### b) Shodan Explanation
- Add a clear explanation of **how Shodan works**.
- Explain **how vulnerabilities are identified** using Shodan:
  - What data is collected.
  - Which indicators used
  - How it indicates the presence of a vulnerability.
  - Limitations and assumptions.

#### c) System Architecture & Implementation Details
- Details on **traffic and event handling**, including:
  - Where events originate.
  - What is handled by the event handler (step-by-step).
  - Detailed **client ↔ test service interaction**.
- Add:
  - **Extensive system architecture description**.
  - **Complete data flow explanation**.
  - **Code snippet** showing:
    - Event handler structure.
    - Input and output.
  - **Output snippets**:
    - Example traffic.
    - Example events.
    - Example responses from the system.

#### d) Challenges & Design Decisions
- Add a dedicated section in paper and presentation describing:
  - **Technical challenges** faced during the **client self-test implementation**.
  - How these challenges were **solved**.

### 3. Presentation - Introduction & Background Section
- Add an **introductory lecture-style section** explaining:
  - How **TLS works for email**.
  - Typical pitfalls when installing or configuring an email server.
  - What “correct configuration” means in practice
